      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I will need to make productive navigation that will be engaging to the viewer. I will also need to separate each type of music into a different genre. I will also need to hook visitors with a good hero image in the front so that they want to stay on the website for a longer period of time. The interesting design and color and font scheme will be enticing to viewers and will allow them to stay engaged in the website. Overall, the main page will just sell the other pages which contain the main idea of the site.

Visitors will come to my site because they will have a more specific and interesting selection of music. Other song browsers do not describe why songs should be listened to.

I will also have a page of all songs so that they can all be in the same place for searching.
